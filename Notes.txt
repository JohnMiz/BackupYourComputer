	Backup Software Checks:
	
	1. If the folder/file is not in the backup drive, copy it to the drive
	2. If the folder/file is in the backup drive, check:
		2.1 If the size of the folder/file is not the same do this
			2.1.1 Iterate over the files and check if the file size and data has changed if they did, replace the files
	
	
	3. Add option for the user to decide if he wants to delete files that exist only in the backup folder
		3.1 Iterate over all the files in dest
			3.1.1 If the file in dest does not exist in source delete it
			3.1.2 If the folder is empty after the 3.1.1 delete it
	4. When pressing start backup open a window log that will show to file that been replaced ...
	
	5. Add a scrollable list the will have the folders and files names with checkbox near them and all the check ones will be backed up
		otherwise they won't
	
	Todo:

	1. Comment the code
	2. Refactor the code
	3. Option to stop/pause backup ?
	4. Use Fody Weavers, find all the implementations of INoifyChanged and replace them
	7. Users system
	8. Unit tests
	9. Tray icon?
	10. Lots of code duplication in ScreenshotsViewModel and DetailsViewModel(Validatefolder, selectfolder, selectfolders)
	11. When exit from the window check if the backup is running
	
	Things to understand better:
		1. Ninject -> Service locator, NinjectModule
		2. StoryBoard
		5. Fody weavers
		7. Understand why Json initialized to null
		
	Aesthetics:
	
	1. Add global fonts to all of the program
	2. Make custom scrollbar
	3. Make a page style for all the pages
	4. Make custom progress bar
	5. Make custom checkbox

	
	Bugs/Fixes:
	
	1. Backup drive needs to be checked for forward slashes for linux compatability
	2. The DetailsViewModel is dependent on DisplayViewModel and every change in DisplayViewModel will make me change DetailsViewModel
	
	Backup page
	
		1. Show the size of the total backup?
		2. Save the file names that raised and execption to let the user know what was'nt backed up?
		
	DisplayBackup Page
	
		1. Improve the algorithm? So it would be more responsive when showing the status - Low Priority
		2. Show how many items were in the begining of the backup
		3. Option to pause and resume a folder's backup
		4. In the end of the backup show a log of the things that were backed up successfuly and those who don't.
		5. What if the file size in the same as before the backup????
		6. Save the backup details to the json file after the user is choosing new folders or new destination
		
	Screenshots Page:
		1. Change the folder's window position to be in the first screen( Take screenshot of the primary window.)
		
	Working right now: 
		1.
