	Backup Software Checks:
	
	1. If the folder/file is not in the backup drive, copy it to the drive
	2. If the folder/file is in the backup drive, check:
		2.1 If the size of the folder/file is not the same do this
			2.1.1 Iterate over the files and check if the file size and data has changed if they did, replace the files
	
	
	3. Add option for the user to decide if he wants to delete files that exist only in the backup folder
		3.1 Iterate over all the files in dest
			3.1.1 If the file in dest does not exist in source delete it
			3.1.2 If the folder is empty after the 3.1.1 delete it
	4. When pressing start backup open a window log that will show to file that been replaced ...
	
	5. Add a scrollable list the will have the folders and files names with checkbox near them and all the check ones will be backed up
		otherwise they won't
	
	Todo:

	1. Comment the code
	2. Refactor the code
	3. Option to stop/pause backup ?
	4. Use Fody Weavers
	7. Users system
	8. Unit tests
	
	Things to understand better:
		1. Ninject -> Service locator, NinjectModule
		2. StoryBoard
		5. Fody weavers
		7. Understand why Json initialized to null
		
	Aesthetics:
	
	1. Add global fonts to all of the program
	2. Make custom scrollbar
	3. Make a page style for all the pages
	4. Make custom progress bar

	
	Bugs/Fixes:
	
	1. Backup drive needs to be checked for forward slashes for linux compatability
	2. The DetailsViewModel is dependent on DisplayViewModel and everychange in DisplayViewModel will make me change DetailsViewModel
	
	Backup page
	
		1. Show the size of the total backup?
		2. Save the file names that raised and execption to let the user know what was'nt backed up?
		
	DisplayBackup Page
	
		1. Improve the algorithm? So it would be more responsive when showing the status - Low Priority
		
		
	Working right now: 
		1. Clean code
