	Backup Software Checks:
	
	1. If the folder/file is not in the backup drive, copy it to the drive
	2. If the folder/file is in the backup drive, check:
		2.1 If the size of the folder/file is not the same do this
			2.1.1 Iterate over the files and check if the file size and data has changed if they did, replace the files
	
	
	3. Add option for the user to decide if he wants to delete files that exist only in the backup folder
		3.1 Iterate over all the files in dest
			3.1.1 If the file in dest does not exist in source delete it
			3.1.2 If the folder is empty after the 3.1.1 delete it
	4. When pressing start backup open a window log that will show to file that been replaced ...
	
	5. Add a scrollable list the will have the folders and files names with checkbox near them and all the check ones will be backed up
		otherwise they won't
	
	Todo:

	1. Comment the code
	2. Refactor the code
	4. Implement the effect of selecting button in the menu
	5. Option to stop backup ?
	8. Use Fody Weavers
	9. Save the last info to a json file?
	
	Bugs/Fixes:
	
	1. Handle the case when a file is been used by another process
	2. Backup drive needs to be checked for forward slashes for linux compatability
	3. When adding new folders the SourceFoldersText in DetailsViewModel is not changing
	
	Aesthetics:
	
	1. Add global fonts to all of the program
	2. when loading page make a fading effect like in ESET https://youtu.be/UZSFY8YdSrA?t=359
	3. Make a page style for all the pages
	4. Make custom progress bar
	
	Things to understand better:
	1. Ninject -> Service locator, NinjectModule
	2. StoryBoard
	3. Templates
	4. Converters
	5. UserControls
	6. Fody weavers
	
	Backup page
	
		1. Make costum buttons - Low Priority
		2. In the header add the start time and end time - Medium Priority
		3. Handle the case when the user wants to do a backup again - Medium Priority
		4. Add error checks, when the backup is running disable choosing source and dest ( use can execute of the Command class)
		5. Make the area of the start up button look good
		
	DisplayBackup Page
	
		1. Improve the algorithm? So it would be more responsive when showing the status - Low Priority
		
	Working right now: 
	1. Saving the data to json file, figure out how to save the data
