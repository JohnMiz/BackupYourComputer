	Backup Software Checks:
	
	1. If the folder/file is not in the backup drive, copy it to the drive
	2. If the folder/file is in the backup drive, check:
		2.1 If the size of the folder/file is not the same do this
			2.1.1 Iterate over the files and check if the file size and data has changed if they did, replace the files
	
	
	3. Add option for the user to decide if he wants to delete files that exist only in the backup folder
		3.1 Iterate over all the files in dest
			3.1.1 If the file in dest does not exist in source delete it
			3.1.2 If the folder is empty after the 3.1.1 delete it
	4. When pressing start backup open a window log that will show to file that been replaced ...
	
	5. Add a scrollable list the will have the folders and files names with checkbox near them and all the check ones will be backed up
		otherwise they won't
	
	Refactor:
		1. Code duplication
		2. Class should change only for one reason
		3. functions should do one thing
		4. Descriptive names
		5. Lots of code duplication in ScreenshotsViewModel and DetailsViewModel(Validatefolder, selectfolder, selectfolders)
		6. Styles
		
	Future Features:

	1. Option to stop/pause backup ?
	2. Use Fody Weavers, find all the implementations of INoifyChanged and replace them
	3. Users system
	4. Unit tests
	5. Tray icon?
	6. Notify the user each X time to do a backup
	
	Things to understand better:
		1. Ninject -> Service locator, NinjectModule
		2. Fody weavers
		3. Understand why Json initialized to null
		4. Async await
		
	Aesthetics:
	
	1. Add global fonts to all of the program
	2. Make a page style for all the pages
	3. Make custom progress bar
	4. Connection strings?
	5. Custom message box
	
	Bugs/Fixes:
	
	1. Backup drive needs to be checked for forward slashes for linux compatability
	2. The DetailsViewModel is dependent on DisplayViewModel and every change in DisplayViewModel will make me change DetailsViewModel
	
	Backup page
	
		1. Show the size of the total backup?
		
	DisplayBackup Page
	
		1. Improve the algorithm? So it would be more responsive when showing the status - Low Priority
		2. Show how many items were in the begining of the backup
		3. Option to pause and resume a folder's backup
		
	Screenshots Page:
		1. Change the folder's window position to be in the first screen( Take screenshot of the primary window.)
		
	Working right now:
		1. Use Fody Weavers, find all the implementations of INoifyChanged and replace them
		2. Solve
